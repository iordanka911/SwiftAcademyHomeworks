                    Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s
                    inhabited by living things.
                    While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
                    system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the
                    biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
                    <br />
                    The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after
                    Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means
                    “the ground.”

                    Potential for Life
                    Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most
                    notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the
                    temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided
                    a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
                    <br />
                    Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the
                    ongoing effects of climate change. To find out more visit our sister website, climate.nasa.gov.

                    Size and Distance
                    <br />
                    With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and
                    the fifth largest planet overall.
                    <br />
                    From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one
                    astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
                    distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances
                    from the Sun.

                    It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.
                    Orbit and Rotation
                    As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to
                    complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar
                    system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit
                    around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's
                    added to is called a leap year.

                    Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around
                    the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern
                    hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher
                    in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating
                    produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall
                    begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

                    <br />
                    Moons
                    <br />
                    Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object
                    in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It
                    stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.

                    Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by
                    Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some
                    asteroids will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.

                    Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the
                    result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock
                    smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and
                    formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon
                    in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).

                    The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30
                    Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.

                    Rings
                    <br />
                    Earth has no rings.

                    Formation
                    <br />
                    When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when
                    gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow
                    terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
