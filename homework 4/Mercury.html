                    The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
                    Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface
                    of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as
                    it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as
                    seven times brighter.
                    Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold.
                    Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can
                    reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to
                    that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
                    Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet
                    in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby
                    Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the
                    fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
                    Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.
                    Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.
                    The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize
                    this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.

                    Size and Distance
                    <br />
                    With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more
                    than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the
                    size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
                    From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million
                    kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the
                    Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance
                    from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes
                    sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.

                    <b>Orbit and Rotation</b>
                    <br/>
                    Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47
                    million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds
                    around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second,
                    faster than any other planet.

                    Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is
                    moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation
                    is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears
                    to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens
                    in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night
                    cycle) equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.
