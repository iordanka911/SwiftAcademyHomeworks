                    ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                    Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence
                    that it was even more active in the past.
                    Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've
                    sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

                    NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
                    (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. 

                    Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down
                    on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million
                    kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.

                    Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the
                    United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021,
                    and includes an orbiter, a lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars
                    from orbit.

                    In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successfully on Mars when its Zhurong Mars
                    rover touched down.

                    An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying the Red Planet from above including three NASA
                    orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN.

                    These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a
                    thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

                    <b>Orbit and Rotation</b>
                    <br/>
                    As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day
                    on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts
                    669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.

                    Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.
                    This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
                    distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit
                    the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the
                    year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of
                    Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.
