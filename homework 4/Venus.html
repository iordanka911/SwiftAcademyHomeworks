                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the
                    four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar
                    in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between
                    the two worlds.
                    Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in
                    thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s
                    the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface
                    temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt
                    lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands
                    of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.

                    Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the
                    pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.

                    Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the
                    other planets in the solar system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in
                    the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth. (It’s not the only planet in our solar system
                    with such an oddball rotation – Uranus spins on its side.)

                    Venus was the first planet to be explored by a spacecraft – NASA’s Mariner 2 successfully flew by
                    and scanned the cloud-covered world on Dec. 14, 1962. Since then, numerous spacecraft from the U.S.
                    and other space agencies have explored Venus, including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet's
                    surface with radar. Soviet spacecraft made the most successful landings on the surface of Venus to
                    date, but they didn’t survive long due to the extreme heat and crushing pressure. An American probe,
                    one of NASA's Pioneer Venus Multiprobes, survived for about an hour after impacting the surface in
                    1978.

                    More recent Venus missions include ESA’s Venus Express (which orbited from 2006 until 2016) and
                    Japan’s Akatsuki Venus Climate Orbiter (orbiting since 2016).

                    NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has made multiple flybys of Venus. On Feb. 9, 2022, NASA announced the
                    spacecraft had captured its first visible light images of the surface of Venus from space during its
                    February 2021 flyby.

                    In June 2021, three new missions to Venus were announced. NASA announced two new missions, and ESA
                    announced one:

                    VERITAS: NASA's VERITAS, or Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy,
                    will be the first NASA spacecraft to explore Venus since the 1990s. The spacecraft will launch no
                    earlier than December 2027. It will orbit Venus, gathering data to reveal how the paths of Venus and
                    Earth diverged, and how Venus lost its potential to be a habitable world.
                    DAVINCI: NASA’s DAVINCI mission will launch in the late 2020s. After exploring the top of Venus’s
                    atmosphere, DAVINCI will drop a probe to the surface. On its hour-long descent, the probe will take
                    thousands of measurements and snap up-close images of the surface. The probe may not survive the
                    landing, but if it does, it could provide several minutes of bonus science.
                    EnVision: ESA has selected EnVision to make detailed observations of Venus. As a key partner in the
                    mission, NASA is providing the Synthetic Aperture Radar, called VenSAR, to make high-resolution
                    measurements of the planet’s surface features.
