                    Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei
                    found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
                    Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than
                    twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

                    Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating
                    in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
                    than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                    One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is currently exploring this giant world.

                    Orbit and Rotation
                    <br>
                    Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the
                    time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around
                    the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).
                    <br>
                    Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means
                    Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.
                    <br>
                    Moons
                    <br>
                    With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.
                    Jupiter has 53 confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons
                    are named after they are confirmed.
                    <br>
                    Jupiter's four largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the
                    astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are
                    known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our
                    solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest
                    moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters
                    indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for
                    life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.
